# Constraint-Optimization-AMPL

This project represents a report on the outcomings of a practical session in the optimization and operational research course. The goal of this practical session is to formulate some realistic problems as optimization problems and use the AMPL software to solve them.
During studying mathematical optimization and constrained problems, it is natural to seek software to be able to solve real-world optimization problems in a practical and specialized technique. Thus, we use AMPL in our solution through out this report to solve the provided problems in the practical session PDF document.
